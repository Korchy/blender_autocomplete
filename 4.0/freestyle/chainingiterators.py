This iterator is in particular built from a unary predicate and a binary predicate. First, the unary predicate is evaluated for all potential next ViewEdges in order to only keep the ones respecting a certain constraint. Then, the binary predicate is evaluated on the current ViewEdge together with each ViewEdge of the previous selection. The first ViewEdge respecting both the unary predicate and the binary predicate is kept as the next one. If none of the potential next ViewEdge respects these two predicates, None is returned.
